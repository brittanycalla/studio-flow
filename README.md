# Studio Flow

Studio Flow is a fullstack web application for high-volume photo studios. 

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, EJS

I created Studio Flow after spanding years freelancing in many fast-paced, high-volume photo studios for major e-commerce retailers across the country. Unfortunately many studios dedicate a majority of their time to organizing shoots, tracking shots and items, and hunting down image files via spreadsheet. Studio Flow is software for your photo studio. Spend less time combing through spreadsheets and more being creative.

## Optimizations

This application passes around a lot of information, which gets very tricky to organize when working with EJS. I'd like to switch this project over to React and eventually look at bringing in a 3rd party state manager if needed.

## Lessons Learned:

As mentioned above, managing joined tables and data in EJS is pretty tricky. Luckily MVC architecture provides some organization to this app. I've also come to appreciate React and it's reusable components, something I hope to implement soon.
